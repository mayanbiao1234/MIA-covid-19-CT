This is ICCV MIA-covid19D CT competition
In the context of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (covid-19) epidemic, the
rapid diagnosis of CT images of pneumonia is particularly important. To
address the problem that classical convolutional neural networks are weak in
extracting spatially isotropic structural association features of 3-dimensional
CT images, this paper investigates 3D convolutional neural networks based
on large-scale pre-trained parameters for extracting and classifying the rich
spatial information of 3-dimensional CT images. In addition, this paper
utilizes the resampling technique in order to unify the size and number
of channels of all CT images. It was evaluated on the COV19-CT-DB
validation dataset, and the F1-score reached 84%.
